This project contains a FastAPI backend (in /backend) and a Vite+React frontend (in /frontend) for a manufacturing quoting app. The backend handles file uploads, quote management, and PDF export. The frontend provides a modern UI for managing parts, operations, and quotes, including file previews for PDF and STEP files.
